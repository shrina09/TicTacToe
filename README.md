A GUI two player TicTacToe and numerical tictactoe game

## Getting Started
### Dependencies

* It requires no prerequisites, libraries, OS version, etc., needed before installing and running your program. Docker and the e-text that was required for this course is sufficent. The java built-in libaries are used and do not need any other external libraries. They are imported in the program to accomadate.

Cannot include it because its GUI

## Limitations
Was not able to do TextUI and implement a text based tictactoe. The file saving does not work properly, and there is no file loading done (no place where a file is taken to read and load the contents of it on the board). It also does not check if the position is already taken for both the players. I used Kakuro game provided as an example. I used it as a base and a guidance for this assignment.
